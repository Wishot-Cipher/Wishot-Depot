    content: `# Building a Modern AI-Powered Portfolio

## Introduction
In today's competitive job market, having a portfolio that stands out is crucial. I decided to integrate AI to create an interactive experience.

## Why AI Integration?
AI-powered features demonstrate:
- Technical skills with modern APIs
- Understanding of user experience
- Forward-thinking approach

## Implementation
I used Groq API for lightning-fast responses. The integration process involved:

\`\`\`javascript
const response = await askGroq(userQuestion);
\`\`\`

## Results
The AI assistant answers questions about my work, making the portfolio interactive and memorable.`,

    excerpt: "Exploring advanced animation techniques that bring websites to life and create memorable user experiences.",
    content: `# The Future of Web Animations

## Introduction
Animations are no longer optional in modern web design. They're essential for creating engaging user experiences.

## Why Framer Motion?
Framer Motion stands out because:
- Declarative syntax
- Spring animations
- Gesture support
- Layout animations

## Getting Started
\`\`\`javascript
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  Hello World
</motion.div>
\`\`\`

## Best Practices
- Keep animations subtle
- Use spring physics for natural feel
- Optimize for performance
- Test on mobile devices`,

    title: "React Performance Optimization Tips",
    excerpt: "Practical strategies to make your React applications blazingly fast and deliver exceptional user experience.",
    content: `# React Performance Optimization

## Introduction
Performance is crucial for user experience. Let's explore proven optimization techniques.

## Key Strategies
1. **Use React.memo()** - Prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **useMemo & useCallback** - Memoize expensive computations
3. **Code Splitting** - Load code on demand
4. **Virtualization** - Render only visible items

## Example: React.memo
\`\`\`javascript
const MyComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
});
\`\`\`

## Measuring Performance
Use React DevTools Profiler to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

## Conclusion
Small optimizations compound. Start with the biggest impact areas first.`,

    content: `# Mastering TypeScript for React Development

## Introduction
TypeScript has become essential for large-scale React applications. It provides type safety and better developer experience.

## Why TypeScript?
TypeScript offers:
- Compile-time error checking
- Enhanced IDE support
- Better refactoring capabilities
- Self-documenting code

## Getting Started
\`\`\`typescript
interface Props {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}

const UserCard: React.FC<Props> = ({ name, age }) => {
  return <div>{name} {age && \`(\${age})\`}</div>;
};
\`\`\`

## Advanced Patterns
- Generic components
- Conditional types
- Utility types
- Declaration merging

## Best Practices
- Use strict mode
- Avoid any type
- Leverage interfaces over types
- Use type guards for runtime checks`,

    excerpt: "Essential practices for creating inclusive web experiences that work for everyone, including users with disabilities.",
    content: `# Building Accessible Web Applications

## Introduction
Web accessibility ensures that websites are usable by people with disabilities. It's not just good practice‚Äîit's often required by law.

## Core Principles
The four principles of accessibility:
- **Perceivable** - Information must be presentable to users
- **Operable** - Interface elements must be operable
- **Understandable** - Content must be understandable
- **Robust** - Content must work with assistive technologies

## Practical Implementation
\`\`\`html
<!-- Semantic HTML -->
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#main">Skip to main content</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main id="main">
  <h1>Accessible Heading</h1>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text" />
</main>
\`\`\`

## Tools and Testing
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Color contrast checkers
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Automated accessibility audits

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Missing alt text on images
- Poor color contrast ratios
- Non-semantic HTML structure
- Lack of keyboard support`,
